# Explanation of Approach to the Assignment

## Introduction
In this document, I will provide an overview of the approach I took in implementing part the assignment, considering the given project tree structure.
I'll aslo explain why we chose the `docker_compose` module over its alternatives.

## 1. Choice of Technologies
### Vagrant
Vagrant was chosen for its ability to create reproducible development environments easily. It simplifies the setup process and ensures consistency across different machines.

### Ansible
Ansible was selected for its simplicity and ease of use in automating server configuration and application deployment. It allows for idempotent configurations, making it suitable for provisioning environments reliably.

### Docker Compose Module
The `docker_compose` module was chosen for managing Docker Compose configurations due to the following reasons:

- **Simplicity**: The `docker_compose` module simplifies the management of Docker Compose projects by providing a straightforward interface for defining and executing commands.
  
- **Integration**: It seamlessly integrates with Ansible, allowing for smooth orchestration of Docker Compose projects as part of larger automation workflows.
  
- **Consistency**: Using the `docker_compose` module ensures consistency in the deployment process across different environments, reducing the likelihood of configuration errors.

## 2. Project Structure
### Directory Structure
The project was organized into several directories to maintain modularity and clarity:

- `roles/`: Contains Ansible roles for specific tasks such as Docker setup, Docker Compose, and Docker service management.
  - `common/`, `docker/`, `docker_compose/`, `docker_service/`: Each directory corresponds to a specific role and contains tasks and handlers related to that role.
- `group_vars/`: Holds group-level variables used across all hosts.
- `playbook.yaml`: The main Ansible playbook responsible for provisioning and configuring the VM.

## 3. Implementation Details
### Docker Compose Module Usage
The `docker_compose` module was utilized for managing Docker Compose configurations due to its ease of use and seamless integration with Ansible. This module allows for defining Docker Compose projects declaratively within Ansible playbooks, enabling efficient orchestration of multi-container applications.

## Conclusion
The chosen approach leveraged Vagrant and Ansible for automating the setup of the development environment, while the `docker_compose` module facilitated the management of Docker Compose projects. By organizing the project into roles and utilizing the appropriate Ansible modules, the implementation is modular, maintainable, and scalable.
